# Buffalo News Work
Portfolio of my data visualizations, maps & apps for the Buffalo News.

## Leaflet maps

### [ParkMap](ParkMap)
Using Leaflet, I built a simple map displaying photographs of the recent construction at the park.

### [MossAccident](MossAccident)
Using the previous Niagara Falls code, I amended the map for a breaking news situation.

## D3 Charts

### [SayYes](SayYes)
To showcase each individual school's college-bound rate, I used a combination of dropdown selection as well as a hover effect to provide context and visibility of the overall trend.

### [NewYorkCollegeSports](NewYorkCollegeSports)
Using data from New York colleges, I compared spending per athletic per team as well as showing how each schools' expenditures compares to similar colleges.

## Newsroom Tools
I've adapted a couple of fantastic open source programs for the newsroom's use.

### [Lunchbox](https://github.com/lexieheinle/lunchbox)
While I created [Buffalo News styles](http://lexie.link/lunchbox), I gained familiarity with the Python microframework, Flask, as well as LESS.

### [dailygraphics](https://github.com/lexieheinle/dailygraphics)
Similar to the Lunchbox application, this project also taught me how to add new flask commands as well as integrate Google Sheets into D3 code.

## Other Projects
Not a map or a graph, these projects are a bit out of the ordinary.

### [Erie County Fair App](FairApp)
Using the Carla Astudillo's [Feats Thru Sheets](https://github.com/CarlaAstudillo/feats_thru_sheets) program, I used IFTTT to pull in reporters' tweets of the Erie County Fair.

### [Erie County Fair Map](https://github.com/lexieheinle/fair-food-twitter)
Using the Seattle Times' [Twitter Mayday map](https://github.com/seattletimes/mayday-twitter), I adapted the code to allow News' journalists to share pictures and locations of fair food.
