# Buffalo News Work
Portfolio of my data visualizations, maps for the Buffalo News.

## Leaflet maps

### [ParkMap](ParkMap)
Using Leaflet, I built a simple map displaying photographs of the recent construction at the park.

### [MossAccident](MossAccident)
Using the previous Niagara Falls code, I amended the map for a breaking news situation.

## D3 Charts

### [SayYes](SayYes)
To showcase each individual school's college-bound rate, I used a combination of dropdown selection as well as a hover effect to provide context and visibility of the overall trend.

## Newsroom Tools
I've adapted a couple of the fantastic NPR Visual's open source programs for the newsroom's use.

### [Lunchbox](https://github.com/lexieheinle/lunchbox)
While I created [Buffalo News styles](http://lexie.link/lunchbox), I gained familiarity with the Python microframework, Flask, as well as LESS.

### [dailygraphics](https://github.com/lexieheinle/dailygraphics)
Similar to the Lunchbox application, this project also taught me how to add new flask commands as well as integrate Google Sheets into D3 code.
